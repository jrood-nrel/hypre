ILU
==============================================================================

ILU is a suite of parallel incomplete LU factorization algorithms featuring dual threshold
(ILUT) and level-based (ILUK) variants. The implementation is based on a domain
decomposition framework for achieving distributed parallelism. ILU can be used as a
standalone iterative solver (this is not recommended), preconditioner for Krylov subspace
methods, or smoother for multigrid methods such as BoomerAMG and MGR.

.. note::
   ILU is currently only supported by the IJ interface.

Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ILU utilizes a domain decomposition framework. A basic block-Jacobi approach involves
performing inexact solutions within the local domains owned by the processes, using
parallel local ILU factorizations. In a more advanced approach, the unknowns are
partitioned into interior and interface points, where the interface points separate the
interior points in adjacent domains. In an algebraic context, this is equivalent to
dividing the matrix rows into local (processor-owned) and external (off-processor-owned)
blocks. The overall parallel ILU strategy is a two-level method that consists of ILU
solves within the local blocks and a global solve involving the Schur complement system,
which various iterative approaches in this framework can solve.

User-level functions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A list of user-level functions for configuring ILU is given below, where each block
of functions is marked as *Required*, *Recommended*, *Optional*, or *Exclusively
required*. Note that the last two blocks of function calls are exclusively required, i.e.,
the first block should be called only when ILU is used as a standalone solver, while
the second block should be called only when it is used as a preconditioner to GMRES. In
the last case, other Krylov methods can be chosen. We refer the reader to
:ref:`ch-Solvers` for more information.

GPU support
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The addition of GPU support to ILU is ongoing work. A few algorithm types have already
been fully ported to the CUDA and HIP backends, i.e., both their setup (factorization) and
solve phases are executed on the device. Below is a detailed list of which phases (setup
and solve) of the various ILU algorithms have been ported to GPUs. In the table,
*UVM-Setup* indicates that the setup phase is executed on the CPU (host); at the same
time, the triangular factors are stored in a memory space that is accessible from the GPU
(device) via unified memory. This feature must be enabled during hypre's configuration.

.. hint::
   For better setup performance on GPUs, disable local reordering by passing option
   zero to ``NALU_HYPRE_ILUSetLocalReordering`` or
   ``NALU_HYPRE_BoomerAMGSetILULocalReordering``. This may degrade convergence of the iterative
   solver.

.. note::
   hypre must be built with ``cuSPARSE`` support when running ILU on NVIDIA
   GPUs. Similarly, ``rocSPARSE`` is required when running ILU on AMD GPUs.
